In this, we are unapologetically at odds with contemporary philosophies. There is an ultimate reality. We corner it by triangulating independent observers who probe what is Out there. This is not the prevailing dogma which has been passed down through the generations, a vestige of the old Imperium. The prevailing dogma denies the separation between the objective and subjective. To them, reality is but a subjective projection, a screen on which elemental observations are changed by the psyche of the observer, painting order on a canvas of chaos. Their look is all inward. Hence their dogmatic interpretation of prescience: the Oracle fixes the future according to what it sees; it does not perceive, as we theorize, the superimposed projection of all future states. We smile and refute this senseless dogma each and every day in our work! Look at what our instruments are capable of. An Ixian paracompass points to the North regardless of its owner&rsquo;s psyche! With the same confidence, we look inside ourselves and find rules, causes and effects. We do not care about the problem of human agency and free will. The universe&rsquo;s laws are God enough for us. </span></p><p class="c13"><span>- </span><span class="c14">THE IXIAN RENAISSANCE</span><span class="c8 c6">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c8"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c8 c6"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The ride up in the elevator was smooth for Reverend Mother Visella, despite the vertiginous vertical speed you could infer by looking through the transparent walls of plexi and out into the rainforest surrounding the building. Trees were fast disappearing on the ground. A few seconds later the door opened, but her body had not noticed any deceleration. The anti-g suspensors underneath this platform were incredibly powerful. Expensive. This building was for top-level bureaucrats, not the rank and file of the administrators. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The robo-helper guided her gently onto the open-air floor organized as a garden, patios and wooden frames designed to create comfortable small meeting areas with low tables, tatami, and chairs. Water fountains splashed everywhere. It was sunrise on this planet she had landed an hour before; she prayed she could take off just as quickly. As she walked along the terrace, she noticed she was at the very top of the tower, but no barriers protected her people from falling down below. Force fields were surely hidden in the exterior walls in order to avoid powerful bureaucrats from smashing on the ground below. How high was she now? The view was obstructed by the garden hedge. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Up a few steps she went, and into a gated area where the robo-server pointed to a shoe rack where she could deposit her sandals, a shallow pool of water and a carved stone basin where to wash feet and hands and face. From there she arrived at a spear-shaped raised platform furnished with pillows and low chairs. A female figure with a wide burnt orange gown and an adherent white blouse was waiting, looking pensive. The blouse&rsquo;s fabric fell down her body in ripples, hiding a flat chest and creating sparkling light effects as the breeze blew softly. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6 c2 c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c4">Here is my bureaucrat! </span><span class="c0">Thought Visella, annoyed. Clearly this was not a planet ever touched by a Reverend Mother, or they would have rushed her through much sooner, and with the courtesy that her station demanded. Instead they sent a robo-server!</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Her host bowed, made a gesture to sit down. Visella chose the low chair, sat, smiled, kept her annoyance and impatience rigidly under control. A scroll inked with fluid calligraphy lines was hanging idle from a divider. Visella invoked her Other Memories to read the ancient kanji: </span><span class="c2 c4">Summer</span><span class="c0">. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6 c2 c4">All this way to meet a bureaucrat&hellip; all these formalities before I can take off again and head home!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6 c2 c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Her host finally broke the silence with her melodious voice: &ldquo;Good morning, Reverend Mother. And what a splendid morning indeed. I am </span><span class="c2 c4">Sapient</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Arbatar Sorgo. A pleasure to meet you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6 c2 c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">She kept quiet, watching the ritual that was performed in front of her. Arbatar kneeled on the tatami and proceeded to clean with a white rectangular hemp cloth several utensils, including a whisk and a white open bowl that was mottled with small azure clouds. Visella noticed how the straight, squared edges of the gray kettle contrasted elegantly with the curves and the hazy hues of the bowl. Water was poured from a black rectangular flagon into a gray kettle, which immediately glowed a faint orange when placed on a stone-like circle. Bubbles came up on the surface of the water. </span><span class="c2 c4">Must be raging hot!</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;thought the Reverend Mother from her small chair. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Still waiting, she focused on the beautiful sunny morning and the rainforest landscape that was stretching just beyond the parapet. The moist air, the yellow light of dawn invited joy and calm, but on the Reverend Mother it had the opposite effect. </span><span class="c6 c2 c4">&nbsp;A beautiful sunrise on a beautiful land&hellip; why am I nervous? Because I need out! This is too tall a building for the mind to soften! There should be howling winds here, not a gentle breeze. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Holding the scaling kettle in her hands, the Sapient Arbatar poured water into the bowl with a sweeping move.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c4">Something is wrong. </span><span class="c2">Realization struck her as she swept her gaze across her host&rsquo;s figure, the angle of the elbow, the perfectly ondulated hair, the curiously long middle finger on her left hand. </span><span class="c6 c2 c4">This is no human. Face Dancer? No. How hot is that kettle she is grasping with her bare hands? By all Gods below! Her skin is not burning. It&rsquo;s a machine!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6 c2 c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Tea?&rdquo; the machine in front of her asked colloquially, placid eyes staring at some point over the hood of the Reverend Mother&rsquo;s aba vest, amusement showing all over. She scooped a green powder from a red ball-shaped container mottled in white, poured it into the bowl and dissolving it in the water with a whisk.</span><span class="c2 c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Matcha powder</span><span class="c6 c2 c4">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Overcoming her rigid Bene Gesserit self-control, Reverend Mother found herself gaping at this uncanny </span><span class="c2 c4">thing</span><span class="c2">, then recomposed herself; but not before she had let a repelled look escape. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6 c2 c4">Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c4 c10"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Gods below! What blasphemy has humanity created here?</span><span class="c2 c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">She thought</span><span class="c2 c4">. And she is the gatekeeper to my safe passage out of here. </span><span class="c2">The Bene Gesserit calm took over once again. </span><span class="c2 c4">My Mission has ended and this is but a stop on the way home. </span><span class="c2">Visella stood in awkward silence. </span><span class="c6 c2 c4">But this could turn out to be a big annoyance. It will be wise to investigate first. Is this a thinking machine, or just an automata somebody else maneuvers? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6 c2 c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The android looked at the bowl, the tea powder completely dissolved in the hot water; put down the kettle and brought the bowl with two hands to her perfectly contoured red lips, taking a ceremonial sip. Then offered it to the Reverend Mother.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6 c2 c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Visella was still young for Bene Gesserit standards, but ten years in the Scattering had left a mark, a wrinkle on under her eyes, her natural beauty had become fiercer, her muscles more sinewy. But somehow she felt aging another decade by that exchange of glances. Her hands accepted the bowl. </span><span class="c2 c4">I am so worn out by my Mission. </span><span class="c0">She opened her lips but not to sip. &ldquo;Is that Gamont&rsquo;s matcha? The leaves&rsquo; fragrance is so unique.&rdquo; She hesitated.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Not quite, but close,&rdquo; spoke her host. &ldquo;It is our best local variety. Harvested in the hills of our southern continent twice a year. But I hear nothing can match the Old Empire&rsquo;s brand. CHAOM ships bring Gamont&rsquo;s matcha tea here sometimes,&rdquo; continued the Sapient, still smiling. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6 c2 c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">A machine&rsquo;s smile could mean anything.</span><span class="c2 c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">And then: </span><span class="c6 c2 c4">CHOAM ships! The venerable trade company from the Old Imperium gets this far! Good, it means they are in mainstream business. No shady operations.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; ventured Visella.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Our Immigration and Customs office. I am its secretary.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Visella sipped in silence. Contrary to what her Memories were telling her was the custom, the Sapient produced a second bowl for herself from behind the little table and cleaned it. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What are you thinking now?&rdquo; the android continued, the direct question going deep into the Reverend Mother&rsquo;s mind. Water poured out of the kettle into the second bowl, hot steam clouds evaporating in the brisk morning air. There they stood on a terrace hundreds of feet above the canopy of a lush tropical forest, colorful birds below them swerving in the light breeze and singing their morning songs. Humidity in the air. It was going to be an oppressively hot morning.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Does it matter? What are </span><span class="c2 c4">you</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c4">thinking</span><span class="c0">?&rdquo; she rebuked.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Thank you for being open to me having a thinking process, Reverend Mother. I am aware of the deep beliefs coming from the ancient Butlerian Jihad. I have come to trust my mental process comes close to yours&rdquo;. She paused while sipping tea. &ldquo;Beginnings like these are interesting. Some risk taking is required. I would ask you to indulge me in a little game. Take this piece of parchment and the pen. We will both write down what is going through our minds right now and then exchange papers.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; replied a puzzled Visella. Just a smile in return. Visella took the pen and scribbled quickly: &ldquo;How do I really know you are a person, and that I should treat you as one?&rdquo; They exchanged sheets. It read: &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know if we think alike, but what harm is in treating each other as such?&rdquo; A smile came to her lips, and she let it be. After all, a smile can mean anything. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We begin with similar thoughts &ndash; or reservations. That is progress,&rdquo; said Arbatar in between sips.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Is it? How do I know who is maneuvering inside your head? This could be an elaborate game you play with every Reverend Mother you meet.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I have never met an </span><span class="c2 c4">original</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Reverend Mother from the Million Worlds. Others who were similar. Not quite, but close. From my vantage point, I ask myself the same question: how do I know your mental process is free? Do you have no masters?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c4">Lectured by a machine! &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">You were programmed, I was not.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Were you not? What are those precious genes, the Atreides genetic lines, that you carry? And the rigorous training? So they are not directing your actions?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Spare me your rhetoric! We are here to talk about my safe passage. Why am I here at this luxury Customs department?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c4">She did not feel danger, but were her instincts reliable in the presence of androids? No Bene Gesserit training had ever considered this! </span><span class="c0">She closed her eyes pretending to savor the matcha (her senses told her it was the real thing, no poison nor narcotics), and sank into Other Memory from the countless Reverend Mothers and progenitors that went back in time, looking for insight. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6 c2 c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c4">Malkesha Tal, you lived during the Butlerian Jihad times! Give me your wisdom! </span><span class="c2">A soft, thin face of the pre-Imperium times came into her field of vision. Malkesha had been a senior Ix programmer at times where Ix made thinking things. </span><span class="c6 c2 c4">Let your memories inform my sensibility here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Indeed. Your safe passage. But where are my manners! You must forgive my thought provoking experiment. I do dabble in the field of philosophy in my free time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You do! Very fitting for a machine!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes, it is. When you know you are different, you wonder whether your words will be understood correctly. How can you verify it? Every word, every gesture speaking to a citizen from the farthest place in the Scattering may mean something different, with </span><span class="c2 c4">consequences.</span><span class="c0">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The last word hung in the air like a bringer of bad news. &ldquo;Hard between humans, and I wonder how deep or shallow our divide is.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You are fully organic,&rdquo; continued the Sapient, &ldquo;and I am not. My appearance is not that different from yours, and in fact you can say my external surface is a camouflage, an imitation of human skin, and I wear clothing. I drink liquids, like this exquisite tea. When I speak to my kind, I know we can communicate. How do I know it is the same with you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Sophisms!&rdquo; Visella rebuked her. </span><span class="c2 c4">Get to the point! I need safe passage and permission to leave this planet if I am to report back to the Missionaria Protectiva. </span><span class="c2">She had ventured to a half dozen planets, disappeared for a decade-long mission, and vital recon information had to be brought back to the Sisterhood for the natural next step. </span><span class="c2 c4">Those planets are ready for a Siona-ghola! Bring the prophetess and spread the rites!</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6 c2 c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I have come to conclude too. After all, I don&rsquo;t need to be similar to </span><span class="c2 c4">you</span><span class="c2">. I certainly do not need, nor aspire to be </span><span class="c2 c4">human</span><span class="c2">.&rdquo; This word also hung in the air, like she had said </span><span class="c2 c4">I do not aspire to be a cooking stove.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&ldquo;By the way, the rice crackers are quite nice,&rdquo; the android continued nodding toward the little tray next to them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;So?&rdquo; </span><span class="c2 c4">This android did love to talk</span><span class="c2">. </span><span class="c6 c2 c4">Patience Sister! It is the first time in our history we make contact with this&hellip; tool! It is means to an end, my safe passage! But maybe there is some useful background.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6 c2 c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The solution is environmental pressures. And natural selection.&rdquo; she continued. The Reverend Mother nodded: &ldquo;We are both shaped by our environment.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Another android smile: &ldquo;And as long as the environment shapes us the same way via the same pressure to survive and perpetuate our kind, I believe both our people have adapted to think alike.. I am optimistic we can truly understand. Different origin, similar necessities. &nbsp;More tea?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">It made sense, uncomfortably. Visella nodded again, looking at the simul-ivory timepiece on her wrist. Her internal time-sense had not adjusted yet to the local circadian rhythms. </span><span class="c2 c4">This meeting is not entirely a waste of time, but I need to go home.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Obviously she could not read an android the way you could read a human. Could she learn another way? She looked into Malkehsal&rsquo;s memory again. </span><span class="c6 c2 c4">Would Truthsay worked on this thing, if I were a Truthsayer?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6 c2 c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;So be it,&rdquo; she permitted, relaxing on her chair. It was a glorious, tropical day. The haze had all evaporated leaving a scenic panorama that, at their height above the canopy, must have been several hundred miles deep to the horizon. Looking outside she felt as a dot in the middle of a circle that </span><span class="c2 c4">was</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;the horizon. &rdquo;I am embracing that we can express ourselves and be understood fully.&rdquo; she noted sarcastically. Large birds of prey roamed the skies, certainly a local breed of giant eagle dating back from the days the planet was terraformed with imported Terran fauna, fifteen-feet wingspan, shrieks that pierced the wind. &ldquo;But I am so curious. May I ask about your kind?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I am sure you have questions,&rdquo; replied the Sapient. &ldquo;I am not reserved, and we happen to be very hospitable here. Ask away.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How old are you?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Around 300 standard years&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6 c2 c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Can you die?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Everything perishes in due time, Reverend Mother.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Were you created?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We build our bodies and hardware, but our software is created by recombination.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand. Like procreation?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Not quite, but close. We breed minds by merging different vectors from different individuals. There can be more than two parents though.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Is your body entirely mechanical or partly biological?&rdquo;<br>No answer, only a smile.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Does your kind have a religion?&rdquo;</span><span class="c2 c4">&nbsp;Always probe for weaknesses</span><span class="c2">, her Missionaria training reminded her</span><span class="c6 c2 c4">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;So you really think we can be similar! I am so elated.&rdquo; presently the android shrugged. </span><span class="c2 c4 c6">Intentionally mimicking human body language? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">The machine put down the bowl, elaborating: </span><span class="c2 c4">&ldquo;</span><span class="c0">We cultivate open-mindedness, and so each one of us can embrace any belief. We do share one common principle though.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;And that is?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Compassion. We believe all sentient beings deserve it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6 c2 c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Voices from Other Memory clamored inside Visella&rsquo;s head. <br>&ldquo;Bullcrap! What do you mean? You are all Buddhists of old? Do you even know the term?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The term is old, and it is what my kind has learned to be a good label for this mental approach. You have to thank some old holo-libraries our human friends brought us from the Famine times.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6 c2 c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Approach to what?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;To interacting with the universe around us. What are we and what are you? What difference it makes if we both think? Sentient beings. The Buddhists never talked about humans. Such a radical concept&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c4">&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">I am speechless. Very human of you!</span><span class="c2 c4">&rdquo; </span><span class="c0">Visella snapped, testing.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Human! But no, that&rsquo;s such a rare belief among humans!&rdquo; smiling again. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Visella leaned back in her small chair, her body pushing against the soft embroidered pillows. Her internal senses were profoundly disconcerted. </span><span class="c2 c4">Where in hell had these creatures emerged from?</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A swirl of other questions followed. &nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c4">Would Voice work with these things?</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Surely not the sexual imprinting the Sisterhood has mastered and was still carefully using. </span><span class="c2 c4">When back to Chapterhouse, we shall send a whole contingent of Sisters and either study or completely isolate this place. The risks! </span><span class="c0">But that was not all, she had noticed the signs of incredible wealth in the size of this planet&rsquo;s spaceport, the expensive construction materials, the decor, this very tower shooting up from the ground up to a mile in height, dominating like an apex predator on the land.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c4">&ldquo;How many?&rdquo;<br></span><span class="c0">&ldquo;We are a small group by choice.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c4">&ldquo;Tell me, does the notion of gender mean anything to you?&rdquo;<br></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s tricky. We have a concept similar to biological sex, but it is not binary. For simplicity you can address me as a she.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">She had to reconsider her predicament. </span><span class="c6 c2 c4">As the Mentat said: &ldquo;Nothing is out of the question in the Scattering!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; continued Arbatar after noting the time marked by her own golden timepiece. &ldquo;Your questions are revealing, but not unusual. Now that our little introduction is over, I will endeavor to get to the point.&rdquo; </span><span class="c2 c4">Finally! Let&rsquo;s drop the pretenses. </span><span class="c2">She stiffened in her chair, all her senses becoming alert. She suspected this long diversion masked the difficulties ahead. If in a corner, she was not sure she could hurt an inorganic </span><span class="c2 c4">machine</span><span class="c0">. Could she invoke her Honored Matres training and speed to the nearest exit? Elevator? How could she flee from here? From an entire planet?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I have your Old Imperium paperwork. I recognize you as a Reverend Mother from our history. Your presence on our planet is a surprise. You are the first Mother we have seen in a century. Old Imperium, too. May I ask what is the purpose of your mission?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I am only in transit. My lighter&rsquo;s life systems malfunctioned on the way back to Junction, and this was the nearest star system with a Goldilock zone.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How did you know there was an inhabited planet here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t. I only knew it was inhabitable. My craft is a light ship. Crew of one. I am trained as a pilot. Limited autonomy left due to a failed air recycling apparatus. I needed fresh air and a base from which to send a distress signal. Or improvise repairs. I am glad this is a populated area, and beg your help to allow me to repair my ship and leave at once. The Bene Gesserit will remember.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You were very lucky to find us here. And sorry to hear about your ship. This place does not usually show up in navigation maps, though we conduct our fair share of business with many worlds.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I have noticed your spaceport&rdquo; continued Visella. An oblique look. &ldquo;Smugglers?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Only proper business. Tropical hardwoods, our signature rose water. Fine tea. Advanced electronics. No weapons, though,&rdquo; A pause. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see how fantastic this is? You really are treating me as a </span><span class="c2 c4">person&rdquo;. </span><span class="c0">That lingered in the air. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Benefit of the doubt, </span><span class="c2 c4">oh sentient being,</span><span class="c2">&rdquo; snapped Visella. &nbsp;A suspicion. </span><span class="c2 c4">&ldquo;</span><span class="c0">Why Arbatar, is this just a ruse? Is this a simulated performance? A Turing test? You are declared conscious if you give me the impression of being so? Who is the puppeteer holding your strings?&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No strings! No tests! Being shaped by the same pressures, remember&rdquo;. Android smile.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Revelation struck.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Aaah. And yours is&hellip;&rdquo; Reverend Mother Visella got up from the chair in a blink. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Survival.&rdquo; Android smile. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Which means&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Please, you are safe here. No harm will come to you, Reverend Mother.&rdquo; Arbatar was standing up with open hands.</span><span class="c6 c2 c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So long as I do not try to leave!&rdquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We do not wish our presence to be noticed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;By whom? The CHOAM? By the </span><span class="c2 c4">sentient beings </span><span class="c2">of my Order? Well I see the extent of your </span><span class="c2 c4">compassion!</span><span class="c0">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Not quite there Reverend Mother, but close. My compassion for you is balanced by the &nbsp;compassion and safety for countless more sentient beings here. And no, we prefer your kind not to know, either&rdquo;. Arbatar relaxed once again, sat back down on her knees and grabbed the bowl. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;And what would happen if I fled, Arbatar?&rdquo; said Visella dropping back onto the chair.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;From a mile-high tower? You can move fast, but you cannot outrun gravity. Or from this planet? On a ship with failing live support? Our crew just completed the ship&rsquo;s capture, by the way. Do sit down, Reverend Mother, and let&rsquo;s be sensible. The day is gorgeous. This planet has all that a human being may long for. This is a wonderful time to be alive. Enjoy the moment. We will get to know each other better, in time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">A pause. Then the Sapient continued: &ldquo;And do try the rice crackers, by the way &mdash; they are quite tasty.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">A furious Visella picked a cracker up and bit into it. It tasted sweet. </span><span class="c2 c4">Like all traps</span><span class="c0">. <br>&ldquo;Tasty, right?&rdquo; said the Sapient. <br>&ldquo;Not quite, but close&rdquo; her bitter answer.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p></body></html>
